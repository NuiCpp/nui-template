# nui-template
A template repository to base new projects off of.

## Transform into your own project:
Replace "nui-template" in this repo with your project name and rename "static/nui-template.html" to that name "static/???.html"
And change in main.cpp `#include <nui_template.hpp>` and `window.setHtml(nui_template());` to that in snake case.
